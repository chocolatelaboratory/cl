      <p>Excitement jumping is one of the most common (and frustrating) behavior issues dog owners face. Whether your dog jumps up on guests, family members, or even strangers, the behavior often stems from excitement, lack of impulse control, or attention-seeking habits. Fortunately, with the right techniques, you can stop this behavior and replace it with calm, polite greetings.</p>

      <h2 class="mt-5">Understand Why Dogs Jump</h2>
      <p>Dogs jump because they’re excited, they want attention, or they simply haven’t learned that it’s not acceptable behavior. Puppies often jump to reach your face or hands, and if this gets rewarded with petting or eye contact, they quickly learn to associate jumping with positive results.</p>
      <p>Before correcting the behavior, it’s important to understand that <strong>jumping is natural</strong>—your goal isn’t to punish excitement, but to <strong>redirect it into calm behavior</strong>.</p>

      <h2 class="mt-5">Ignore the Jumping (No Touch, No Talk, No Eye Contact)</h2>
      <p>The first rule of stopping jumping is this: <strong>don’t reward it with attention</strong>. Even negative reactions (like yelling or pushing the dog down) can reinforce the behavior. Instead:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Turn your back when your dog jumps.</li>
        <li>Cross your arms and avoid eye contact.</li>
        <li>Stand still and wait for your dog to calm down.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Once all four paws are on the ground, <strong>immediately reward with praise, a treat, or petting</strong>. This teaches that calm behavior gets attention — not jumping.</p>

      <h2 class="mt-5">Teach an Incompatible Behavior (Like “Sit”)</h2>
      <p>Training your dog to perform an incompatible behavior like “sit” or “place” when greeting people is highly effective.</p>
      <p><strong>How to do it:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ask your dog to <strong>sit</strong> before someone approaches.</li>
        <li>If your dog stays seated, reward them.</li>
        <li>If they get up and jump, the person should immediately <strong>turn away</strong> and disengage.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="mt-5">Practice Calm Entries and Exits</h2>
      <p>A lot of excitement builds when you come home — this is often when jumping is the worst. To prevent this:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ignore your dog for 30 seconds after entering the home.</li>
        <li>Only give attention when they’re calm and all four paws are on the floor.</li>
        <li>Practice going in and out of the door multiple times to desensitize them to your arrival.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="mt-5">Use Tools (If Needed)</h2>
      <p>If your dog is overly persistent, you can pair training with management tools such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A short leash indoors to control jumping.</li>
        <li>A dog gate or pen to give them space to calm down.</li>
        <li>Tethering your dog during greetings so they learn to stay in one place.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These aren’t long-term solutions but can help during training.</p>

      <h2 class="mt-5">Be Consistent and Patient</h2>
      <p>Like any training, stopping excitement jumping takes time. Everyone in your household needs to follow the same rules:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Don’t allow jumping “just this once.”</li>
        <li>Reward calm behavior <em>every single time</em>.</li>
        <li>Be consistent, even if it feels repetitive.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>With daily practice and the right mindset, your dog can learn to greet people politely without leaping in excitement.</p>
