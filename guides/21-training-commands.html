          <!-- Start Repeat for each command -->
          <section class="mb-5">
            <h2 class="h4 fw-bold">Sit</h2>
            <p>The “Sit” command is one of the first things most dogs learn. It teaches your dog to lower their rear end and hold that position until released. This foundational command sets the tone for obedience and is a good place to start training.</p>
            <p>“Sit” is particularly helpful in daily situations like putting on a leash, waiting before crossing the street, or greeting people politely. A sitting dog is generally calmer and easier to control.</p>
            <p>To teach it, hold a treat close to your dog’s nose and slowly move it upward and slightly back. As their head tilts up, their rear will naturally go down. As soon as they sit, praise and reward. Repeat often in short sessions.</p>
          </section>
          <section class="mb-5">
            <h2 class="h4 fw-bold">Stay</h2>
            <p>The “Stay” command teaches your dog to remain in a specific position—whether sitting, standing, or lying down—until released. It builds patience and is vital for safety and structure.</p>
            <p>This command is useful in busy or risky areas where you don’t want your dog moving, like near roads or during vet visits. It’s also helpful at home to prevent unwanted wandering.</p>
            <p>Start with your dog in a sit or down position. Say “Stay” while holding your hand out like a stop sign. Step back briefly, return, and reward if they didn’t move. Gradually increase distance and duration as your dog improves.</p>
          </section>

          <section class="mb-5">
            <h2 class="h4 fw-bold">Come</h2>
            <p>“Come” is a recall command that brings your dog directly back to you. It’s one of the most important commands for off-leash control and emergency situations.</p>
            <p>A strong recall can keep your dog safe from hazards like cars, wildlife, or unfriendly dogs. It also builds trust and gives your dog more freedom during outdoor activities.</p>
            <p>Train it by calling your dog excitedly (“Come!”) while kneeling or backing up. Reward generously when they reach you. Always make “Come” a positive experience—never use it to scold your dog.</p>
          </section>

          <section class="mb-5">
            <h2 class="h4 fw-bold">Down</h2>
            <p>“The “Down” command instructs your dog to lie down with their chest and belly on the floor. It encourages calmness and can prevent impulsive behaviors like jumping or pacing.</p>
            <p>It’s ideal for managing excitement in public places or when you need your dog to stay still for longer periods, such as during meals or visits.</p>
            <p>Hold a treat near your dog’s nose and lower it straight down to the floor. As their head follows, slide the treat forward so they stretch out and lie down. Praise immediately when their elbows touch the ground.</p>
          </section>

          <section class="mb-5">
            <h2 class="h4 fw-bold">Heel</h2>
            <p>“Heel” teaches your dog to walk beside you in a controlled manner, usually on your left side. It eliminates pulling and creates a more enjoyable walking experience.</p>
            <p>This command is especially useful in crowded or high-traffic areas where pulling or lunging can become dangerous.</p>
            <p>To train it, walk slowly with your dog beside you and reward them for staying in position. Use a short leash and verbal cues like “Heel” to reinforce proper walking behavior.</p>
          </section>

          <section class="mb-5">
            <h2 class="h4 fw-bold">Off</h2>
            <p>“Off” tells your dog to remove themselves from furniture, people, or any raised surface. It helps prevent jumping and enforces boundaries.</p>
            <p>Unlike “Down,” which asks your dog to lie down, “Off” is a correction used when they are on something they shouldn’t be, like a couch or your lap uninvited.</p>
            <p>When your dog jumps up, say “Off” in a firm voice and guide them down if needed. Praise once all four paws are on the ground. Be consistent to prevent confusion.</p>
          </section>

           <section class="mb-5">
            <h2 class="h4 fw-bold">Leave it</h2>
            <p>“Leave it” trains your dog to ignore or avoid an object, distraction, or temptation. It’s crucial for preventing dangerous or undesirable behavior.</p>
            <p>Whether it’s food on the ground, another animal, or something toxic, “Leave it” can be a lifesaving command.</p>
            <p>Hold a treat in your closed hand and say “Leave it.” When your dog stops trying to get it and looks away, reward them with a treat from your other hand. Practice with gradually more tempting items.</p>
          </section>

           <section class="mb-5">
            <h2 class="h4 fw-bold">Drop it</h2>
            <p>“Drop it” teaches your dog to release something from their mouth. It’s essential for safety and respectful play.</p>
            <p>This command is especially useful if your dog picks up something dangerous or won’t let go during tug-of-war.</p>
            <p>To teach it, offer a toy and then show a treat. Say “Drop it,” and when they release the toy to get the treat, reward and praise. Practice with different items and increase difficulty over time.</p>
          </section>

           <section class="mb-5">
            <h2 class="h4 fw-bold">Wait</h2>
            <p>“Wait” tells your dog to pause temporarily and not move forward. It’s slightly different from “Stay,” which asks for longer stillness in place.</p>
            <p>Use it at doorways, in cars, or before meals. It’s helpful for short-term control in daily routines.</p>
            <p>Ask your dog to “Wait” and hold your hand out. If they stay put, quickly release them with “Okay” and a reward. Practice in many small everyday situations for consistency.</p>
          </section>

           <section class="mb-5">
            <h2 class="h4 fw-bold">No</h2>
            <p>“No” is a general correction cue that stops your dog from continuing an unwanted behavior. It’s best used clearly and consistently to mean “That’s not okay.”</p>
            <p>Dogs respond best to calm but firm corrections. “No” should not be yelled or used aggressively, or it may create confusion or fear.</p>
            <p>Pair “No” with redirection to the correct behavior. For example, if your dog chews furniture, say “No,” then offer a toy to chew instead. Praise when they make the right choice.</p>
          </section>

           <section class="mb-5">
            <h2 class="h4 fw-bold">Okay</h2>
            <p>“Okay” is a release word that lets your dog know they are free to move, eat, or break from a previous command like “Stay” or “Wait.”</p>
            <p>Using a clear release word helps your dog understand when a task is done. It creates structure and avoids confusion.</p>
            <p>Only say “Okay” when you want your dog to end a behavior. Consistency with this cue makes commands like “Stay” much stronger.</p>
          </section>

           <section class="mb-5">
            <h2 class="h4 fw-bold">Look</h2>
            <p>“Look” or “Watch me” directs your dog’s focus to your face or eyes. It’s a valuable command for improving attention and communication.</p>
            <p>This command is often used to redirect from distractions, during obedience training, or to calm anxious dogs.</p>
            <p>Hold a treat near your face and say “Look.” Reward the moment your dog makes eye contact. Over time, build duration and distance before rewarding.</p>
          </section>

           <section class="mb-5">
            <h2 class="h4 fw-bold">Quiet</h2>
            <p>“Quiet” teaches your dog to stop barking or whining on cue. It’s useful for managing excessive noise at home or in public.</p>
            <p>First, allow your dog to bark once or twice, then say “Quiet” in a calm voice. Reward silence immediately, even if it's brief.</p>
            <p>Avoid yelling or punishing barking—this can increase anxiety. Rewarding calmness is more effective long-term.</p>
          </section>

           <section class="mb-5">
            <h2 class="h4 fw-bold">Place</h2>
            <p>“Place” tells your dog to go to a specific spot, like a mat or bed, and stay there until released. It’s perfect for creating calm behavior during busy times.</p>
            <p>It’s helpful when guests visit, during meals, or when you want your dog out of the way without crating them.</p>
            <p>Train it by leading your dog to the mat, saying “Place,” and rewarding them for stepping on it. Use “Stay” while they remain there, and release with “Okay.”</p>
          </section>

           <section class="mb-5">
            <h2 class="h4 fw-bold">Watch me</h2>
            <p>“Watch me” asks your dog to focus on your face. It’s useful for engagement, especially during training sessions or distractions.</p>
            <p>This command helps create a habit of looking to you for direction, which strengthens obedience overall.</p>
            <p>Use a treat to lure their gaze to your eyes, then say “Watch me” and reward. Practice in increasingly distracting environments to reinforce it.</p>
          </section>

           <section class="mb-5">
            <h2 class="h4 fw-bold">Stand</h2>
            <p>“Stand” tells your dog to stand up on all fours and remain still. It’s often used during grooming, vet exams, or show handling.</p>
            <p>It can also be helpful in obedience training as a break from sitting or lying down.</p>
            <p>Teach it by gently guiding your dog up from a sit or down position, saying “Stand,” and rewarding once they’re stable. Use calm praise to avoid excitement.</p>
          </section>

           <section class="mb-5">
            <h2 class="h4 fw-bold">Come here</h2>
            <p>“Come here” is a more casual recall command, typically used in the house or backyard. It encourages closeness and response without the urgency of “Come.”</p>
            <p>This phrase can help strengthen recall without overusing the formal command.</p>
            <p>Use it during play or training to reinforce closeness. Always reward when your dog approaches you, even if they were slow.</p>
          </section>

           <section class="mb-5">
            <h2 class="h4 fw-bold">Back up</h2>
            <p>“Back up” trains your dog to step backward. It’s great for tight spaces, doorway control, or refining positioning.</p>
            <p>It can also be a fun trick or part of more advanced obedience or agility work.</p>
            <p>Stand in front of your dog and gently step toward them while saying “Back up.” Use hand gestures or treats to guide the movement. Reward each step back.</p>
          </section>

           <section class="mb-5">
            <h2 class="h4 fw-bold">Shake</h2>
            <p>“Shake” teaches your dog to lift a paw and place it in your hand, like a handshake. It’s a fun, friendly trick that most dogs enjoy learning.</p>
            <p>It also gets your dog comfortable with paw handling, which is helpful for grooming or vet visits.</p>
            <p>Ask your dog to sit, then say “Shake” and gently lift a paw. Praise and reward. Eventually, your dog will offer the paw on their own.</p>
          </section>

           <section class="mb-5">
            <h2 class="h4 fw-bold">Roll over</h2>
            <p>“Roll over” is a playful trick that asks your dog to lie down and rotate fully onto their back and side.</p>
            <p>It builds trust and flexibility and can be a crowd-pleaser during demonstrations.</p>
            <p>Start with your dog in a down position. Use a treat to lure their nose back toward their shoulder, then around. Reward small progress steps as they learn the motion.</p>
          </section>
          
          <section class="mb-5">
            <h2 class="h4 fw-bold">Speak</h2>
            <p>“Speak” teaches your dog to bark on cue. It can be fun, but it also helps with alert behaviors or controlling when your dog barks.</p>
            <p>When used properly, this command can also help you teach the opposite—“Quiet”—by contrasting the two.</p>
            <p>Encourage barking by creating excitement (e.g., knocking or playing). Say “Speak,” then reward when your dog barks. Pair with hand signals for better results.</p>
